        STEP 1
        <br>
        Cook the rice as you normally would, then drain, spread it out to allow it to dry and set aside.
        <br>
        <br>
        STEP 2
        <br>
        Heat oil of your choice in a pan over a high heat, then add the onion and fry until brown. 
        <br>
        Add the rice, stir and toast for about 3 mins, then move to the side of the pan.
        <br>
        <br>
        STEP 3
        <br>
        Add the remaining oil, then add the eggs and stir them while they are in the pan. 
        <br>
        Leave to cook a little, then add the rice and keep stirring to mix the two.
        <br>
        <br>
        STEP 4
        <br>
        Add sesame oil, pepper and soy sauce to your liking but be careful not to burn the rice in the mean time.
        <br>
        <br>
        STEP 5
        <br>
        If you are feeling extra fancy feel free to add some cooked prawns on top.
        <br> 
        Tip into a serving bowl and decorate with spring onions and sesame seeds (only if you have them of course) for that extra presentation.
